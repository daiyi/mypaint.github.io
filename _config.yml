description: > # MyPaint is an easy-to-use painting program which works well with
  Wacom graphics tablets and other similar devices. It comes with a large brush
  collection including charcoal and ink to emulate real media, but the highly
  configurable brush engine allows you to experiment with your own brushes and
  with not-quite-natural painting.
