MyPaint is an Open Source Project for the Artist Community. The Code 
has been built from many years of volunteer developer and artists alike 
to be what it is today. So what can you do to get involve?

##Developers##

###Code Base###
MyPaint is mostly written in Python (using the GTK toolkit), with the 
brush engine written in C++. We also use Glade for UI design and 
layouts. We use git for code maintenance and the main repository is 
currently located on Github. To get started visit our 
[Contributing Wiki Page][contribute] for information on programming, 
fixing bugs, and triaging methods. You can also go to our issue page 
for [MyPaint][MyPaint-issues] or its brush engine 
[libmypaint][libmypaint-issue] as well. We also have a dedicated 
[Developer's Area][developers] for those who need help or a place where 
developers can chit chat away.

### Packaging ###
What good is our code if we can't get it for people to use. All our 
releases source tar-balls are available on our Github 
[release page][release]. You can get started building for your specific 
distribution on the [README.md] file on our source. There you will get 
instructions on how to build not only for Linux, but also Mac OS X and 
Windows. We also have a repository for building for 
[Debian and Ubuntu][debian] as well.

###Web Development###
MyPaint.Org uses Jekyll as it's static page generator. We mainly use 
HTML and CSS and avoid using JavaScript as much as possible. You can 
get started developing our website by going to our 
[MyPaint.Org Documentation Wiki][org].

##Non-Developers##

###Documentation###
As much as contributing code is important to MyPaint, so is 
documentation. Without documentation, developing on MyPaint will be 
difficult to say at the least. We are rewriting new documentation on 
our Wiki Page. To get started writing Documentation, please 
[read this Wiki][doc] for an idea of what we are looking for.  You can 
also take a look at our 
[issue tracker with the documentation label][label] for a place to get 
started.

###Translating##
Help MyPaint reach a more international audience by helping us 
translate it to your language. We use [Weblate] which is a free 
web-based translation management system.  Visit our 
[Translation Wiki][trans] Wiki page to get started.

###Artists###
We created MyPaint for the intention of Artists using it. We love to 
see what you made with it. Post your Artwork on our Discourse Site in 
the [Artwork Showcase Category][showcase]. The Artwork will have to 
abide by our [Licensing Policy][policy], but we will only need it for 
promotional needs. If you want to share a tutorial, brushes or other 
resources for MyPaint, visit our discourse site in the 
[Resources category][resources].

###Testing and Bug Reporting###
We strive to keep our master branch of MyPaint stable, but it's not 
always the case. To test MyPaint you need to build it from source. 
Don't worry building MyPaint is actually quite easy. Instructions for 
building for Linux, Mac OS X, or Windows are in the [README.md] file 
in the source code. Before you create a new issue, be sure to read our 
[Reporting Bugs Wiki][bugs] to avoid unnecessary problems.

###Communities###
Want to connect with other artist who use MyPaint. Well look no further 
since we have a few place you can check out. First and foremost is our 
new [Discourse Site][site] where you can post your artwork for others 
to see; collaborate with other artist; share resources and tutorials; 
and above all have fun. Here are a couple more communities you can join.

* Deviantart: [MyPaint Group][group]
* Reddit: [/r/mypaint][reddit]

Well where ever you plan to get involve, we are glad to have you aboard.
