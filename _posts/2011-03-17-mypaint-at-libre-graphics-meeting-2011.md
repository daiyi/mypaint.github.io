The [Libre Graphics Meeting](http://www.libregraphicsmeeting.org/) (LGM)
is the conference for developers and users of free and open source
graphics applications. This years edition will be in Montreal, Canada
between May 11th and 13th. All the biggest libre graphics projects like
GIMP, Krita, Inkscape, Blender and Scribus are expected to be
represented. The conference will include talks, panel discussions,
workshops and
