Quick note to say that MyPaint is now frozen for the upcoming 1.2.0
release. Expect announcements here about dates for specific betas, plus
previews and screenshots of new features; however the most current
project status can be seen on our 
[Github milestones page](https://github.com/mypaint/mypaint/milestones).
