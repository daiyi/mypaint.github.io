Libre Graphics Meeting, or LGM for short, is a conference for users and 
developers of free and open source graphics software. It brings together 
people from many projects, including 
[Inkscape](http://www.inkscape.org/), [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/), 
[Krita](http://www.krita.org/) and [Blender](http://www.blender.org/), 
and aims to foster collaboration and sharing of ideas.

This year, LGM is held in Brussels, Belgium between 27th and 30th of 
May. MyPaint will be represented, for the first time, by at least 
project leader Martin Renold and developer 
[Jon Nordby](http://www.jonnor.com/). Obvious highlights so far 
includes Martins proposed technical talk on 
[C/C++ extensions for Python](http://create.freedesktop.org/wiki/Extending_Python_for_Speed) 
and the planned [OpenRaster](http://create.freedesktop.org/wiki/OpenRaster) 
[BoF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds_of_a_Feather_(computing)) 
session. There will undoubtedly be many other interesting things going 
on when so many great people with similar interests come together.
