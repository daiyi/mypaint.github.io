# MyPaint.org

Hello! This is the MyPaint website. It is under development.

## Setting up locally

You must first install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation) and [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/pages/download). If you plan on ever doing another ruby project ever again you might want to install ruby with a version manager (such as [rvm](rvm.io/)). If this means nothing to you don't worry about it (:

Fork this repo and clone it to your machine. Then, within your project directory, use RubyGems to install Jekyll and Bundler:

```
gem install jekyll bundler
```


Install the gem dependencies:

```
bundle install
```

Run the website locally:

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Go to http://127.0.0.1:4000 and see the website!
